# javascript-web-OC

## Description
This repository contains all of the exercises for the online course "Create interactive web pages with Javascript", on OpenClassrooms.com. My answers may vary from what the teachers asked to do: as all of my work is uploaded on my website, I tried to optimize the number of files used. Also, my answers may be very different from what the solutions proposed are.

## Structure
I decided to have only three (3) files for the whole course:
* "index.php" is a list of all exercises, with a link to each one.
* "exos.php" is a general php file, containing the exercises. A switch case allows me to display only the selected exercise (from "index.php").
* "jsweb.js" is my Javascript file, with all functions. Some functions, not asked by OC teachers, were added to comply with my way of organizing the files on my website.

## Access
As previously stated, all of those exercises are available on my website, through:

[Javascript Exercises OC](http://exos.davidrei.fr/javascript-web/)

I'm training other languages too, as I am eager to learn more and more. As my training courses are in French, there may be a lot of French names or comments in those files, though I'm trying to open my code to everyone.

All of other exercises are available through:
